ALS Dataset Analysis and Prediction
This project focuses on the analysis and prediction of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) using a dataset containing patient data. ALS is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that affects nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord. The goal of this project is to use machine learning techniques to gain insights into the dataset and build predictive models to support early diagnosis.

Features
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Insightful visualizations and statistical analysis of the ALS dataset.
Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values and data transformation.
Predictive Modeling: Supervised machine learning models, including decision trees, random forests, and support vector machines, are used to predict ALS progression.
Evaluation: Performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are computed to evaluate model performance.
Dataset
The dataset contains various attributes related to ALS patients, including demographic information, clinical features, and biomarkers. The data is preprocessed to prepare it for machine learning tasks.
